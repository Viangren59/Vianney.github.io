            <p>Le Relais is a social enterprise whose mission is to lift people out of poverty by offering them employment, a salary, responsibilities, and support that respects their needs. It is well known across Europe for collecting second-hand clothing and employing people to sort, repair, and sell these clothes. This virtuous model not only gives clothing a second life and prevents tons of waste each year, but also helps thousands of people escape unemployment. </p>
            <p>In Madagascar, Le Relais began operations in 2008, initially focusing on clothing upcycling. However, the extent of poverty and the daily challenges people face pushed the organization to diversify its activities to improve life in Fianarantsoa and create as many jobs as possible. They developed new ventures including rice production, data labeling, trash collection and treatment—and even launched the first African car brand: KARENJY. </p>
            <p>The story behind the creation of this car is quite epic, and I’d love to tell you more about it in person! Le Relais has been designing and building a 4x4 vehicle, made for Malagasy roads, by Malagasy people. The entire production process is in-house, located in one building in Fianarantsoa. Occasionally, they seek external help for specific projects—and that’s why I chose to spend six months discovering the incredible work of this company and contributing however I could. </p>
            <p>My first project was with the maintenance team, composed of five talented mechanics who could fix anything. They helped me feel welcome, taught me the language, guided me through the culture, and became true friends. The team was struggling with frequent corrective maintenance and had no tools to plan ahead or transition to preventive maintenance. Over two months, I worked with them to audit the entire machine park, listing every action item, consumable, spare part, and tool. We built an <span class="tage">autonomous preventive maintenance planner</span> using a free version of Excel.

                Each day, the planner displayed all necessary tasks and allowed the team to proactively check machines to avoid breakdowns. I coded the planner in VBA, learning along the way, and made sure to involve the team at every step. By co-developing the tool and gathering their feedback, they felt true ownership—and used it naturally. As a result, corrective maintenance was reduced by 40% over the six months I was there.</p>
            <p>Another project I led tackled an issue with <span class="tage">composite doors</span>. The manufacturing process created a smooth surface on only one side of the composite panels, causing the internal window-opening mechanisms to jam over time due to vibrations. Since no reference plans were used to align the window system, the team had to manually fit each part using spacers, which eventually came loose. I redesigned the composite molds to incorporate internal reference surfaces, which solved the alignment issue and significantly reduced assembly time.</p>
            <p>Finally, I addressed a major fire safety concern. Madagascar’s equivalent to PG&E, the Jirama, is unreliable and cannot be trusted for consistent water pressure. Yet the building’s fire safety system depended entirely on it—posing a serious risk. I redesigned the fire safety system: recharging all expired extinguishers, installing automatic fire balls in critical electrical cabinets, and <span class="tage">creating a pressurized hose system</span>.I mapped the entire building to determine optimal hose placements and calculated the necessary pressure to reach all areas. I sized a new pump, installed a 500L water tank elevated 6 meters off the ground, calculated pipe losses, and connected the system. By my final day, the hoses were fully operational, delivering an 18-meter water jet for 10 continuous minutes—enough time for firefighters to arrive.</p>
            <p>This incredible adventure, of course, went far beyond engineering work—but I’ll stop here for the sake of this portfolio. I’d be more than happy to share more in person.
