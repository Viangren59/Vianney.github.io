            <p>In Madagascar, my roommate was working for a charity called AFFD (Aide aux Files et aux Femmes en Detresse, meaning Help to desperate girls and woman ), which helps young girls in need find a safe place and escape a life of misery. Most of these girls have suffered sexual abuse, have been former prostitutes, or are fleeing abusive households. They are often tragically young—between 12 and 18 years old—and need a safe environment to recover and learn how to support themselves.</p>
            <p>AFFD provides them with housing and teaches them a variety of practical skills to help them become autonomous and independent. When I arrived in Madagascar, the girls were learning how to sew, garden, raise livestock, and speak foreign languages. The charity was considering opening a bakery training program, but there was no budget for it.</p>
            <p>So, I decided to work with my roommate to raise funds through Facebook and build a functional oven large enough to bake 50 loaves of bread per day. The project lasted about four months, from researching what refractory materials were available locally, to learning from local bakers, to calculating the optimal oven dimensions and design.</p>
            <p>We built the oven and its supporting structure over four weekends. We asked for help from friends, neighbors, colleagues, and the girls themselves—everyone was eager to contribute and create something meaningful. I created CAD models in SolidWorks to estimate material needs, we negotiated prices with suppliers, and in the end, we built a great oven. The front door was made of steel sheets, Arc welded, and the structure was made of brick, cement, a reinforced concrete layer and a thermal mixture of dirt, manure, and termite soil.</p>
            <p>Today, the bakery training program is up and running, and the girls can now dream of becoming bakers and earning a living. They followed the building process step-by-step, and now, they would be able to build a similar oven themselves if they needed to.</p>
