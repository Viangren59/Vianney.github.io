            <!-- <h3>I'm Vianney</h3>
            <span class="tag">Mechanical engineer, solution finder and innovative maker.</span> -->
        
            <p>I joined Rossini Energy for a short-term contract. The start-up was 3 years old and specialized in designing, installing, and operating charging stations for electric vehicles. The CEO wanted to diversify his portfolio, expand the brand, and bring a solar dimension to his company. After exploring different potential products, we agreed to try to build a solar carport to charge cars with solar energy. The product had to be made of wood and modular. With a budget of 20,000 euros, I had 4 months to design a new product and build a functional prototype in the parking lot.</p>
            <p>I immediately started sketching concepts in my notebook and working through equations to estimate a decent solar surface, annual energy production, average charging time, a rough estimation of the cost savings, and ROI for a customer. Within a week, I had developed a CAD model on Fusion 360, was running structural simulations to resist wind and hold the panel, and had already started reaching out to potential suppliers.</p>
            <p>Keeping up with the fast-paced environment and enjoying the collaborative aspect of the project,, I learned how to draw power electrical circuits, negociate prices with all of the suppliers, design a structure to respect the EU norms, select the right waterproofing solution, create an embedded charging station, and remotely measure AC current with a Raspberry Pi.  4 months, assembled a functional 4-car solar carport in the parking lot.</p>
            <p>The system could charge exclusively using solar energy or combine solar and grid power for faster charging. I had access to real-time current monitoring, and the company car could charge directly under the solar roof.</p>
            <p>I was incredibly fortunate to be trusted, mentored and supported by the CEO and the team. I had the opportunity to collaborate with passionate individuals eager to share their knowledge and to contribute to a project with real environmental impact. It was a dream assignment, helping me realize that with strong leadership and a meaningful purpose, I can always find a way to thrive..</p>
