    <h1>The water immersion cooling project - on going experiment to improve Data center cooling efficiency</h1>
    <p>This project is a personal endeavour, that I'm leading in partnership with my company HARTING and UC Berkeley. Data center are responsible for about 2% of the world's energy consuption, and cooling is on average 40% of the Data Center's energy need. </p>
    <p>As a passionate engineer, I'm dreaming of a better cooling solution for the technology that's gonna be at the root of our future society and economy. I'm very convinced that immersion is a great efficient solution to cooling CPUs and GPUs. I would love to be the first to pair its benefits to the incredible thermal propreties of water that make D2C cooling solutions so efficient.</p>
    <p>That's why, since 2024, I'm actively trying to explore the potential of water immersion cooling, and evalute its performance, its scalability and safety challenges. I've put together a capstone team at UC Berkeley to help me build a physical bench test to compare water immersion cooling to dielectric immersion cooling. The new immersion solution relies on a coating that would prevent any short circuit on the boards, while allowing for great thermal dissipation to water.</p>
    <p>Together, we've build a fully functional test bench to test heating PCBs and understand how fast we can remove heat from them, and at what energetic cost. The test bench includes 2 cooling loops connected by a heat exchanger. Stay tuned for the first data sets the team is gathering right now...</p>
    <p>If you also see great potential in exporing better ways to cool Data centers, feel free to reach out.I always love to talk about similar minded people and dream of making a better world together !/p>
